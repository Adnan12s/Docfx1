# Features of DOcFxDocs

DOcFxDocs provides a number of powerful features to help streamline your documentation process and make it easier to manage your code documentation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic API Documentation**
By analyzing your C# projects and `.csproj` files, DocFX generates API documentation from your code comments. This allows you to keep your documentation up-to-date with the latest changes to your code.

### 2. **Support for Custom Markdown Files**
In addition to API documentation, you can also create custom guides, tutorials, and reference material using Markdown files. These files can be easily integrated into your documentationâ€™s Table of Contents.

### 3. **Search Integration**
DocFX allows you to integrate a search feature into your documentation, making it easy for users to find the content they need.

### 4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
Host your documentation for free using GitHub Pages, enabling you to share your documentation with the world without managing your own infrastructure.
