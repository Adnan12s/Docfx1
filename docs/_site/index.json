    "keywords": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Here are some common questions and answers to help you get started with DOcFxDocs. Q1: What is DocFX? Answer: DocFX is a documentation generation tool developed by Microsoft. It supports API documentation generation from .NET projects and allows you to create additional content using Markdown files. It's widely used for maintaining comprehensive documentation for projects. Q2: How do I generate API documentation? Answer: You can generate API documentation by running the docfx build command. This command scans your .csproj files and generates API documentation based on your source code comments and structure. Q3: How do I add custom guides to the documentation? Answer: You can add custom Markdown files to the docs folder of your project. Once you create the Markdown file, reference it in the toc.yml file so it appears in the Table of Contents of your documentation. Q4: How can I host my documentation on GitHub Pages? Answer: You can host your documentation by pushing the contents of the _site folder (generated by DocFX) to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository. GitHub will automatically serve the site from this branch. Q5: How can I update my documentation? Answer: You can update your documentation by making changes to your source code or Markdown files and running docfx build again. Afterward, push the changes to the gh-pages branch to update your live documentation. If you have more questions, feel free to check the official DocFX documentation or open an issue on our GitHub repository."
